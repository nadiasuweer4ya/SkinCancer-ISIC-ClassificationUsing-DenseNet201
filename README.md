# Deployment 🌺
In the deployment part, I have created a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Suweeraya/SkinCancer_Classification) Spaces to host the model and make it readily accessible. 💐

# Inspiration 🌟
I’m truly inspired by the legendary physicist, Richard Feynman 🌟. He’s undeniably cool, and what motivates me the most is his unwavering passion for physics. Even though my focus is machine learning in healthcare, his ambition resonates with me deeply.

Feynman’s way of grasping the complexities of the universe through imagination is just mind-blowing. I absolutely love that about him. His relentless work ethic pushes me to explore and learn everything about the world.

In simple terms, Richard Feynman’s life story keeps me inspired and driven to expand my horizons and understanding.
